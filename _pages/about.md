Hello! I am a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder(CU). 
I work with [Prof Claire Monteleoni](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/claire-monteleoni/) in the 
[Climate & Machine Learning Boulder (CLIMB)](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/claire-monteleoni/research/climate-machine-learning-boulder-climb) at CU.
I pursued my undergraduate studies in Math and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. This summer, I did
an internship at Microsoft research in their [AI for Good lab](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ai-for-good-research-lab/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection of computer vision and machine learning with my research 
focused on their applications related to climate change impacts and sustainability. 
My long term goal is to build innovative and efficient solutions for multiple aspects of sustainable development. 
Through my research, I have made contributions to real world applications such as detecting extreme events with the help of satellite imagery, providing
probabilistic forecasts of renewable energy at longer lead-times, and currently, I am developing a ML pipeline to predict the
future trends of sea level change.

I love to cook, watch tennis and bike and I am enjoying my time in Boulder!
