  abstract={Global mean sea level is rising at a rate unprecedented in the historical era as indicated by
satellite altimetry retrievals since 1993. Recent studies have shown that the forced responses of
greenhouse gas and aerosols have begun to emerge in the pattern of rise during the altimeter data
and many features can be tied directly to these influences. Our work investigates future patterns
of sea level change. To do this, we use machine learning (ML) applied to climate model outputs to
understand the extent of causal contributions from different factors including greenhouse gases,
industrial aerosols, and biomass burning aerosols. We apply deep learning-based spatio-temporal
forecasting techniques to climate model simulations to learn a model of the underlying complex
climate patterns responsible for the observed sea level rise. The ultimate goal is to exploit the
learned patterns and the observed altimeter data to generate projections of sea level rise 30 years
into the future. Specifically, we train a UNet model which is a fully convolutional neural network
with an encoder and decoder architecture defining a U-shape. We add dilations in the convolution
filters to increase the model’s receptive field and capture long-term spatial dependencies. This
model takes in sea level maps at 2 degrees of spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution
and outputs a projection 30 years ahead at the same spatial resolution. These maps are
converted from sea surface height to linear trend estimates (in mm/year) calculated over 30
years, to reduce monthly variability. Input trend maps are for years from 1930 to 2040; we keep 20
years for validation and 10 for the test set. A weighted mean squared error (MSE) is used as a loss
function, where the weights are derived from the cosine of the latitude of all the spatial points. By
training our ML model with the CESM1 and CESM2 large ensemble experiments, we show an
RMSE of ~0.11mm/year for the predicted sea level trend on the test data. We also demonstrate
improvements against a persistence model as a baseline. The next steps are to include more
climate models and to adapt the ML model that learned complex spatiotemporal features in
climate model data to the observed altimetry data, in order to produce future projections.},
